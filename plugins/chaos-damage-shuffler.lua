plugin.description =
[[
	This is a mod of the excellent Mega Man Damage Shuffler plugin by authorblues and kalimag.
	Get swapped to a different game upon taking damage. Supported games listed below. What is 'damage' depends on the game!
	If your ROM is not recognized, no damage swap will occur. Most of the time, NTSC-U versions are supported.
	For Battletoads games, you can choose the level where you start and enable other bonuses.
	Multiplayer shuffling supported.
	Randomizers should be supported (e.g., ALTTPR, VARIA, ZOoTR, SMZ3) by adding your game's hash to the .dat file.
	Additional ideas from the TownEater fork have been implemented.
	Thank you to Diabetus, Smight and ConstantineDTW for extensive playthroughs that tracked down bugs!

	ENABLE EXPANSION SLOT FOR N64 GAMES! This should be the default configuration, but check!

	YOU WILL NEED BizHawk 2.10 MINIMUM for Sega CD and Sega Saturn games to be recognized and shuffled correctly!

	NICHE ZONE
	- NES 240p Suite: shuffles on every second that passes in Stopwatch Mode. Can be useful for testing a single game.


	----PREPARATION----
	Set Min and Max Seconds VERY HIGH, assuming you don't want time swaps in addition to damage swaps.
	If adding N64 games, enable the Expansion Slot. Some games will fail to shuffle or crash BizHawk without it.

	Non-Battletoads games: just put your game in the games folder.

	Battletoads games:
	To run the game just like any other game, simply put it in the games folder.
	If you intend to use the plugin's level skip to shuffle multiple levels at once:
	-Put multiple copies of your ROM into the games folder - one for every starting level you want to include.
	-Rename the ROM files to START with two-digit numbers, like 01, 02, 03, etc., as below.

	Battletoads (NES):
	-Level range: 01 to 13
	-How to level select: Automatically enabled.

	Battletoads in Battlemaniacs (SNES):
	-Level range: 01 to 08
	-How to level select: Pimple will start with 1 HP and no lives if you specify a level higher than 1, OR if you click the "I want Rash" option. Let Pimple die. Then, if using Pimple, continue (the continue gets refunded), or if using Rash (1p or 2p), just let the timer run out. You get an on-screen reminder to do this, and the reminder is gone when you shuffle back.

	Battletoads-Double Dragon (NES):
	-Level range: 01 to 14
	-How to level select: the Level select screen is automatically enabled. A message on screen the first time will tell you which level to pick after character select.

	Battletoads-Double Dragon (SNES):
	-Level range: 01 to 14
	-How to level select: A message on screen the first time will tell you what level to pick after you choose characters. But, for now, you have to enable level select yourself :(
	--OPTION ONE: just enter the cheat code at the character select screen. The screen blinks when it's entered correctly.
	--OPTION TWO: Patch your ROM(s) with the Game Genie code DD6F-1923. Here is a patcher! https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1054/

	----BATTLETOADS EXAMPLES AND TIPS----
	To shuffle every single level of Battletoads NES, make 13 copies with filenames starting with 01 through 13.

	You can include one copy each of all these Battletoads games, with no special naming, to simply have damage shuffling starting from level 1.

	If you want a Battletoads-Double Dragon run without mid-level checkpoints (1-1, 2-1, 3-1, ... 7-1), then only add files that start with: 01, 03, 06, 09, 11, 13, 14.

	You could do an "all Turbo Tunnels" run with BT NES = 03, BTDD (either/both) = 05, and BT SNES = 04. Throw in Surf City (BT NES 05), Volkmire's Inferno (BT NES 07), Roller Coaster (BT SNES 06), the awful spaceship levels (BTDD 09 and 10)...


	----OPTIONS----

	Infinite Lives will make it far easier to progress. The lives refill on each swap.
	- Thank you to kalimag for work that made infinite lives persist through your final game!
	- Infinite lives do not activate for the second player on NES Clinger-Winger on an unpatched ROM, since P2 can't move. Use the patch if you want two-player Clinger-Winger for some reason!
	- Several games do not have 'lives' to make infinite, such as Anticipation, Super Metroid, A Link to the Past, and others. Nothing will change in these games with this option.
	- ADVANCED: To override individual games (for example, to turn OFF infinite lives for a given game): find #TO_OVERRIDE_INFINITE_LIVES in this plugin and consult the example.

	Auto-Clinger-Winger NES: You can enable max speed and auto-clear the maze (level 11).
	-- You MUST use an unpatched ROM for this option to activate. The second player will not be able to move, so only Rash can get to the boss in 2p. Infinite Lives will be disabled for the second player in this scenario to prevent a softlock.
	-- You still have to beat the boss. If you use Infinite Lives, this could make Clinger-Winger fairly trivial.

	Rash 1-player mode in Battlemaniacs (SNES): see above! Start in 2p, let Pimple die and let the continue timer run out to deathwarp. Make sure your 2p controller is mapped the same as 1p aside from Start, so you can progress. In the future, this may be more automated.

	Debugging: Rearm the shuffler logic even if no new game was loaded - useful for testing new games/revisions if not using the damage-debug plugin. You can set PAUSE_ON_SWAP in the plugin to true if you want BizHawk to pause every time a swap would otherwise happen.

	Suppress Logs: if you do not want the lua console log to tell you about file naming errors, or unrecognized ROMs. This can help keep the log cleaner if you are also using the Mega Man Damage Shuffler or other plugins!

	Grace period: 10 frames is the default minimum frames between swaps. Adjust up as needed. This idea originated in the TownEater fork of the damage shuffler!

	Enjoy? Send bug reports?

-- If your health falls 40, you go from 6 boxes to 5. Anything from 41-47 will still show 6 boxes.
-- At 32, you have 4 boxes. At 24, 3 boxes. And so on - until a death at HP = 0.
-- We only want to shuffle when the # of HP on screen changes, because 'light' damage (say, of only 2 HP from a chop by one of the pigs at the beginning) gets partially refilled over time.
-- So, dividing the current HP value by 8, then rounding up, gives us the number of health boxes the toad has.

-- #TO_OVERRIDE_INFINITE_LIVES
-- Typically, if a game can give you infinite lives, CanHaveInfiniteLives will be set to true.
-- You can override this for as many individual games as you want.
-- To turn off infinite lives in a game, use its tag here (in this example, Ninja Gaiden 1) like so, but without the double hyphens that comment these out:

-- gamedata['NinjaGaiden1_NES'].CanHaveInfiniteLives = false

-- Some games can handle infinite lives but will have them turned off by default, for balance/difficulty purposes.
-- Example: Wild Guns (SNES)
-- To override this, write a line like so, without the double hyphens:

-- gamedata['WildGuns_SNES'].CanHaveInfiniteLives = true

-- You can simply un-comment the above line (remove the double hyphens) for Wild Guns specifically.
-- Note that, if a game is not programmed to give infinite lives, setting its CanHaveInfiniteLives to true here won't do anything.

-- FINAL NOTE: BEFORE UPDATING YOUR PLUGIN, COPY-PASTE THE LINES YOU ADD HERE TO SOMEWHERE SAFE, SO YOU CAN RE-ADD THEM
-- this concludes #TO_OVERRIDE_INFINITE_LIVES
